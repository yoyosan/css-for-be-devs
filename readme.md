# Modern CSS for Backend Developers

## Episode 1: Piece by Piece - Structure, Resets and Flexbox

* Mentally visualize the structure in your head:
    * Oh, it looks like there's a background color.
    * Next, it sounds like there are two sections.
    * Get these two components on the left and right.
    * etc.
* You write it out.
* Then you take it step by step.

## Episode 2: Flex Your Grids

An utility class is a class that:
* is not the most semantic thing in the world
* helps you build up styling for your components
* it has to be as minimal as possible in order to be reused anywhere

The css property `flex: 1, 2, 3, etc.` will allow the component to
take twice, 3 times as much space than the others. 

## Episode 3: Workshop - Card Design

Like episode 1 but with more tinkering.

When you set `flex-direction: column` the axis for `align-items: center` reverses.
